## Testing

### Scripted

`sbt scripted` runs the scripted tests. Note that for the `sbtix/private-auth` test you will need to have the `./serve-authenticated.py` server running.

### Integration

The `tests` directory contains further integration tests. Move
to the `tests` directory and run the appropriate `run.sh` from
there.
